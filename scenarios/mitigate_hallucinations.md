## 🎯 Overview and Objectives

This document provides actionable best practices to reduce hallucinations—instances where models generate inaccurate or fabricated information—when using LLMs. We highlight strategies for effective prompt engineering, data grounding, evaluation, and security using Azure AI services (Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Foundry, Prompt Flow, and Content Safety).

### 🏆 Outcomes:
- Reduce hallucinations through robust retrieval and prompt strategies.
- Improve accuracy, relevance, and trustworthiness in model outputs.
- Implement a layered evaluation and security approach that meets enterprise requirements.

## 📚 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Best Practices

RAG helps ground model outputs in relevant, pre-curated data, reducing hallucinations by ensuring answers reference accurate and up-to-date information.

### A. 📂 Data Preparation and Organization
- Clean and curate your data.
- Organize data into topics to improve search accuracy and prevent noise.
- Regularly audit and update grounding data to avoid outdated or biased content.

### B. 🔍 Search and Retrieval Techniques
- Explore different methods (keyword, vector, hybrid, semantic search) to find the best fit for your use case.
- Use metadata filtering (e.g., tagging by recency or source reliability) to prioritize high-quality information.
- Apply data chunking to improve retrieval efficiency and clarity.

### C. 🛠️ Query Engineering and Post-Processing
- Use prompt engineering to specify which data source or section to pull from.
- Apply query transformation methods (e.g., sub-queries) for complex queries.
- Employ reranking methods to boost output quality.

## 📝 Prompt Engineering Best Practices

High-quality prompts guide LLMs to produce factual and relevant responses. The following techniques reduce misinformation and hallucinations.

### A. 📌 Clarity and Specificity
- Write clear, unambiguous instructions to minimize misinterpretation.
- Use detailed prompts, e.g., **"Provide only factual, verified information. If unsure, respond with 'I don't know.'"**

### B. 📐 Structure 
- Break down complex tasks into smaller logical subtasks for accuracy.
- **Example: Research Paper Analysis**
  - ❌ **Bad Prompt (Too Broad, Prone to Hallucination):** "Summarize this research paper and explain its implications."
  - ✅ **Better Prompt (Broken into Subtasks):**
    1. **Extract Core Information:**  "Summarize the key findings of the research paper in 3-5 bullet points."
    2. **Assess Reliability:**  "Identify the sources of data used and assess their credibility."
    3. **Determine Implications:**  "Based on the findings, explain potential real-world applications."
    4. **Limit Speculation:**  "If any conclusions are uncertain, indicate that explicitly rather than making assumptions."

### C. 🔁 Repetition
- Repeating key instructions in a prompt can help reduce hallucinations. The way you structure the repetition matters. Here are some best practices:
  - **Beginning (Highly Recommended):** The start of the prompt has the most impact on how the LLM interprets the task. Place essential guidelines here, such as: "Provide only factual, verified information."
  - **End (For Final Confirmation or Safety Checks):** Use the end to reinforce key rules. Instead of repeating the initial instruction verbatim, word it differently to reinforce it, and keep it concise. For example: "If unsure, clearly state 'I don't know.'"

### D. 🔥 Temperature Control 
- Adjust temperature settings (0.1–0.4) for deterministic, focused responses.

### E. 🧠 Chain-of-Thought
- Incorporate "Chain-of-Thought" instructions to encourage logical, stepwise responses. For example, to solve a math problem: "Solve this problem step-by-step. First, break it into smaller parts. Explain each step before moving to the next."

## 📊 Evaluating Model Outputs and Continuous Improvement

Regular evaluation is essential to monitor performance, detect hallucinations, and mitigate unintended behaviors.

### A. 🧪 Automated Test Generation
- Use LLMs to generate diverse test cases covering multiple inputs and difficulty levels.
- Simulate real-world queries to evaluate model accuracy.

### B. 📈 Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics
- **Common quantitative metrics:**
  - **Relevance:** (0–1 scale)
  - **Perplexity:** (lower is better)
  - **BLEU scores:** (translation similarity)
  - **ROUGE scores:** (summarization effectiveness)
- Complement automated metrics with human review of flagged cases.

### C. ⚖️ Evaluations Using Multiple LLMs
- Cross-evaluate outputs from multiple LLMs.
- Use ranking and comparison to refine model performance.
- Be cautious—automated evaluations may miss subtle errors requiring human oversight.

## 🔐 System-Level Mitigations and Safeguards

While RAG and prompt engineering reduce hallucinations, a holistic, layered defense strategy is necessary for production deployments.

### A. 🛡️ Layered Defense Approach
- **Model Layer:** Use fine-tuned models and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for safety.
- **Safety System:** Leverage Azure AI Content Safety for automated filtering of harmful or inaccurate content.
- **Metaprompt and Grounding:** Define system-level instructions (metaprompts) to establish capabilities and safety boundaries.
- **User Experience:** Provide transparent guidelines and encourage users to verify outputs.

### B. 🔑 Security and Data Management
- Secure API keys with **Azure Key Vault** instead of hard-coding secrets.
- Restrict public access to Azure OpenAI Service using private endpoints and **Azure Virtual Network**.
- Apply **Microsoft Entra ID** with role-based access control (RBAC) for data protection.
- Align encryption, compliance, and storage strategies with organizational policies.

### C. 👀 Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Throughput Management
- Track operational metrics:
  - **Tokens per Minute (TPM)**
  - **Requests per Minute (RPM)**
  - **Overall throughput**
- Use **Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Prompt Flow diagnostics** to track latency, usage, and system errors.
- Enable dynamic quota management to handle traffic spikes without service degradation.
